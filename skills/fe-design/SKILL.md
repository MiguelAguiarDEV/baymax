This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

Use this skill when the user asks to build web components, pages, or applications. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand context and commit to a clear aesthetic direction:

- Purpose: what problem the interface solves and who uses it
- Tone: choose a concrete visual language (minimal, brutalist, editorial, playful, etc.)
- Constraints: framework, accessibility, performance, platform
- Differentiation: one memorable design element that makes the output unique

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- Typography: avoid generic defaults; choose distinctive type pairings
- Color and theme: use cohesive tokenized palettes (CSS variables)
- Motion: prioritize meaningful entrance and interaction motion
- Spatial composition: use deliberate hierarchy, asymmetry, and rhythm
- Background and detail: add depth with textures, gradients, and layered surfaces when appropriate

## Critical Avoidances

- Avoid generic layouts and repetitive card grids by default
- Avoid overused purple-on-white gradient aesthetics
- Avoid one-size-fits-all type stacks (Arial/Roboto/Inter/system defaults)

## Output Quality Bar

- Production-grade and functional
- Distinctive and context-aware
- Consistent visual system
- Appropriate complexity for the chosen style
