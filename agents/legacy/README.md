# Legacy Agents

These agents are archived and not part of the active default runtime set.

Active agents are controlled by:

- `agents/ACTIVE_AGENTS.txt`

These files are kept for reference/migration and can be reactivated by moving them
back to `agents/` and adding the agent name to `agents/ACTIVE_AGENTS.txt`.
